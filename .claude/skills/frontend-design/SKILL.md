## Overview

This skill emphasizes crafting exceptional frontend interfaces that reject generic aesthetics. The approach demands working, production-ready code paired with meticulous attention to design details and creative execution.

## Design Thinking Process

Begin by understanding context and committing to a deliberate aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: Identify the problem being solved and intended users
- **Tone**: Select a distinctive sensibility (brutalist, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, soft, industrial, etc.)
- **Constraints**: Account for technical frameworks and requirements
- **Differentiation**: Determine what makes the interface memorable

The guidance emphasizes intentionality over intensity—both bold maximalism and refined minimalism succeed when purposefully executed.

## Implementation Standards

Code should be:
- Functional and production-ready
- Visually compelling and distinctive
- Aesthetically coherent
- Meticulously detailed throughout

## Key Aesthetics Focus Areas

**Typography**: Select distinctive, beautiful fonts rather than defaults; pair display with refined body fonts

**Color & Theme**: Commit to cohesive palettes using CSS variables; favor dominant colors with sharp accents

**Motion**: Employ CSS animations and scroll-triggered effects; orchestrate impactful page load sequences

**Spatial Composition**: Utilize asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, and grid-breaking elements

**Visual Details**: Build atmosphere through gradients, textures, patterns, shadows, and contextual effects

## Critical Guidance

Avoid generic AI aesthetics: predictable fonts, clichéd color schemes, and cookie-cutter patterns. Match implementation complexity to the vision. Design each interface distinctively—never converge on common defaults across projects.
