description: Verify alignment with PRD before making changes
---

<instructions>
Before proceeding with any work, verify alignment with the Product Requirements Document.
</instructions>

<agent_integration>
**If Advanced Agent System is installed** (check for `.claude/agents/registry.json`):

<trigger_agent>healthcare-validator</trigger_agent>
<condition>domain === 'healthcare'</condition>

<agent_workflow>
If `.claude/domain.json` indicates `"domain": "healthcare"`, the **healthcare-validator agent** will:
- **PHI Detection**: Scan for Protected Health Information exposure
- **HIPAA Validation**: Verify compliance with Security and Privacy Rules
- **Evidence Chain**: Ensure audit trail requirements are met
- **Claims Processing**: Validate against CMS requirements

This runs AFTER basic PRD alignment check, providing domain-specific compliance validation.
</agent_workflow>

<fallback>
If agent system NOT installed or domain is not healthcare, use basic PRD alignment check below.
</fallback>
</agent_integration>

<scope_verification>
### 1. Scope Verification
**What PRD sections apply to this work?**
- [List relevant sections with numbers/titles]

**Is this change explicitly in scope?**
- YES: [Quote supporting PRD section]
- NO: [Explain what's missing from PRD]
- UNCLEAR: [What needs clarification]
</scope_verification>

<out_of_scope_check>
### 2. Out of Scope Check
**What is explicitly OUT of scope per the PRD?**
- [List excluded items relevant to this work]

**Does this change violate any exclusions?**
- YES: [Which exclusion and why]
- NO: [Confirmed clear]
</out_of_scope_check>

<requirements_coverage>
### 3. Requirements Coverage
**Which specific requirements does this satisfy?**
- Requirement ID: [e.g., REQ-3.2]
- Requirement text: [Quote from PRD]
- How this work addresses it: [Explanation]
</requirements_coverage>

<compliance_impact>
### 4. Compliance Impact
**Does this work touch:**
- [ ] Regulated data (PII, PHI, claims data)
- [ ] Evidence chain (audit trail, provenance)
- [ ] AI/ML predictions (lifecycle, versioning)
- [ ] Legal/compliance obligations

**If YES to any, PRD sections that govern this:**
- [List with quotes]
</compliance_impact>

<verification_questions>
### 5. Verification Questions
**Unanswered questions before proceeding:**
1. [What's unclear in PRD]
2. [What assumptions being made]
3. [What needs stakeholder confirmation]
</verification_questions>
</analysis>

<decision>
**PROCEED** if:
- Change is explicitly in PRD scope
- No exclusions violated
- All compliance touchpoints documented
- Assumptions are minimal and safe

**STOP** if:
- No PRD support found
- Violates out-of-scope exclusions
- Compliance impact unclear
- Major assumptions required
</decision>

<next_steps>
If PROCEED:
- Document PRD sections in feature/task description
- Add requirements traceability to commit message
- Update features.json with PRD section references

If STOP:
- Flag for PRD update/clarification
- Document gap in docs/PRD-GAPS.md
- Escalate to product owner
</next_steps>
