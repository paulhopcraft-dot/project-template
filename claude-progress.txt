# Claude Progress Log

## Session 2 - 2025-12-31

### Completed
- Added semi-autonomous mode to CLAUDE.md
- Created AUTONOMOUS-GOVERNANCE.md with full safety protocols
- Added task planning behavior (show plan for new tasks)
- Added "it's up to you" response handling
- Synced toolkit to 10 projects (gpnet3, goassist3, govertical, goconnect, GoAgent, etc.)
- Set up global permissions in ~/.claude.json
- Cleaned up .claude/settings.local.json

### Lines of Code Today
- ~79,000 lines across all projects

### Next Steps
- Test toolkit in a real project (goassist3 avatar work)
- Consider creating lite version with 5 essential commands

### Notes
- Toolkit now operates semi-autonomously by default
- Always shows plan before new tasks
- User can say "it's up to you" and Claude will propose next task
