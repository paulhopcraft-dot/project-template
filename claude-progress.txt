- Morning: 5 commits (AI_ORCHESTRATOR, /config, morning-brief)
- Afternoon: 4 commits (Python tests, gomemory setup)
- Evening: 3 commits (SEO strategy, progress updates)

### Next Steps
1. **Restart terminal** - yt-dlp will be available in PATH
2. **Test morning-brief** - Run `.\morning-brief.ps1` in fresh terminal
3. Fix gomemory test failures (8 tests - MEDIUM priority)
4. Fix gocontrol load test (HIGH priority)
5. Begin GoMemory feature development → 80% completion (CRITICAL)
6. Implement SEO strategies for products (HIGH priority)

### Notes
- yt-dlp installed but needs terminal restart to work
- gomemory now testable (CRITICAL blocker removed)
- SEO strategy documented for all 7 products
- AI_ORCHESTRATOR v1.1 is active as permanent governance layer
- All work committed and pushed to origin

## Session 5 - 2026-01-05

### Completed
- Fixed Python test environment in run-tests-simple.ps1
  - Added venv activation before running pytest
  - Implemented pytest output parsing to handle warnings correctly
  - Added "SETUP NEEDED" status for projects without venv
  - Provides setup instructions in test output
- Re-ran full ecosystem test suite with Python fixes
- **✅ Setup gomemory venv and ran tests (CRITICAL priority completed!)**
  - Created Python venv in gomemory
  - Fixed pyproject.toml (added hatchling packages config)
  - Installed all dependencies (fastapi, anthropic, boto3, pytest, etc.)
  - Ran test suite: **78/87 tests passing (89.7%)**
  - Committed fixes: gomemory e074458, toolkit ed179f7
- Updated ECOSYSTEM-TEST-REPORT.md with all findings
- Pushed all changes to origin
  - 2de8547, 01c635e, 8f54289, ed179f7

### Current Test Status (Ecosystem Health: 85.7%)
- 4 projects FULLY PASSING (100%): gpnet3, goconnect, govertical, GoAgent
- 2 projects with minor issues:
  - gocontrol: 173/174 tests (99.4%) - 1 concurrent load test failing
  - **gomemory: 78/87 tests (89.7%)** - 5 mock failures, 3 migration errors
- 1 project without tests: goassist3 (low priority)

### Key Discoveries
- **gomemory pyproject.toml fix**: Missing hatchling config prevented editable install
  - Added: `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] packages = ["src"]`
  - Result: Successfully installed 50+ dependencies, tests now running
- **gomemory test failures (8 total)**:
  - 5 failures: AttributeError mocking 'src.api.db'
  - 3 errors: ImportError for alembic migrations
  - Impact: MEDIUM priority - 90% passing, not blocking
- **gocontrol**: 1 concurrent load test failing (test_authorize_50_concurrent_users)

### Next Steps
- Fix gomemory test failures (MEDIUM priority)
- Fix gocontrol load test (HIGH priority)
- Begin GoMemory feature development to reach 80% (CRITICAL per TODO.md)

## Session 4 - 2026-01-04

### Completed
- Fixed encoding issues in run-ecosystem-tests.ps1 (Unicode symbols)
- Created run-tests-simple.ps1 (simplified test runner)
- Executed ecosystem tests across all 7 projects
- Generated ECOSYSTEM-TEST-REPORT.md with detailed analysis
- Fixed GoAgent calendar test (860/860 tests now passing)
- Committed both test infrastructure and GoAgent fix
  - Toolkit: 14e6d2c "test: add ecosystem test runner and comprehensive report"
  - GoAgent: 4c8c05d "fix: calendar test now passes on weekends"

### Test Results Summary
- 3 projects PASSED: gpnet3, goconnect, govertical
- 1 project with 1 failing test: GoAgent (calendar.find_free_slots)
- 2 projects with environment issues: gocontrol, gomemory (pytest not in PATH)
- 1 project without tests: goassist3 (no test configuration)

### Key Findings
- GoAgent: 859/860 tests passing (99.9%) - 1 calendar test failing
- Python projects need venv activation in test runner
- Overall ecosystem health is good for Node projects

### Next Steps
- ✅ FIXED: GoAgent calendar test - configured 7-day working hours
- Fix Python test environment (activate venv before pytest)
- Add test configuration to goassist3

### Fix Details
- **Issue**: Calendar test failing on weekends (today is Sunday)
- **Root Cause**: MockCalendarService only included Mon-Fri (days 1-5) as working days
- **Solution**: Modified F038 test suite to initialize calendar with all 7 days as working hours
- **Result**: All 860 tests now passing (was 859/860)

## Session 2 - 2025-12-31

### Completed
- Added semi-autonomous mode to CLAUDE.md

- Synced toolkit to 10 projects (gpnet3, goassist3, govertical, goconnect, GoAgent, etc.)
- Set up global permissions in ~/.claude.json
- Cleaned up .claude/settings.local.json

### Lines of Code Today
- ~79,000 lines across all projects

### Next Steps
- Test toolkit in a real project (goassist3 avatar work)
- Consider creating lite version with 5 essential commands

### Notes
- Toolkit now operates semi-autonomously by default
- Always shows plan before new tasks
- User can say "it's up to you" and Claude will propose next task
