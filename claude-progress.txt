# Claude Progress Log

## Session 5 - 2026-01-05

### Completed
- Fixed Python test environment in run-tests-simple.ps1
  - Added venv activation before running pytest
  - Implemented pytest output parsing to handle warnings correctly
  - Added "SETUP NEEDED" status for projects without venv
  - Provides setup instructions in test output
- Re-ran full ecosystem test suite with Python fixes
- Updated ECOSYSTEM-TEST-REPORT.md with current findings
- Pushed all changes to origin
  - 2de8547 "feat: improve Python test environment handling"
  - 01c635e "docs: update ecosystem test report with Python venv findings"

### Current Test Status
- 4 projects FULLY PASSING: gpnet3, goconnect, govertical, GoAgent
- 1 project with 1 load test failing: gocontrol (173/174 tests - 99.4%)
- 1 project needs venv setup: gomemory (CRITICAL priority per TODO.md)
- 1 project without tests: goassist3 (low priority)

### Key Discoveries
- **gocontrol**: venv working, but 1 concurrent load test failing
  - Test: `test_authorize_50_concurrent_users` in performance suite
  - Impact: HIGH - gocontrol is authorization layer for entire platform
- **gomemory**: No venv exists, needs `python -m venv venv && pip install -e .[dev]`
  - Priority: CRITICAL - needs to reach 80% completion before SMB launch
- **Test runner improvements**: Now handles Python projects correctly with proper error messages

### Next Steps
- Fix gocontrol concurrent load test (HIGH priority)
- Setup gomemory venv and run initial tests (CRITICAL priority)
- Consider addressing goassist3 test coverage (LOW priority)

## Session 4 - 2026-01-04

### Completed
- Fixed encoding issues in run-ecosystem-tests.ps1 (Unicode symbols)
- Created run-tests-simple.ps1 (simplified test runner)
- Executed ecosystem tests across all 7 projects
- Generated ECOSYSTEM-TEST-REPORT.md with detailed analysis
- Fixed GoAgent calendar test (860/860 tests now passing)
- Committed both test infrastructure and GoAgent fix
  - Toolkit: 14e6d2c "test: add ecosystem test runner and comprehensive report"
  - GoAgent: 4c8c05d "fix: calendar test now passes on weekends"

### Test Results Summary
- 3 projects PASSED: gpnet3, goconnect, govertical
- 1 project with 1 failing test: GoAgent (calendar.find_free_slots)
- 2 projects with environment issues: gocontrol, gomemory (pytest not in PATH)
- 1 project without tests: goassist3 (no test configuration)

### Key Findings
- GoAgent: 859/860 tests passing (99.9%) - 1 calendar test failing
- Python projects need venv activation in test runner
- Overall ecosystem health is good for Node projects

### Next Steps
- ✅ FIXED: GoAgent calendar test - configured 7-day working hours
- Fix Python test environment (activate venv before pytest)
- Add test configuration to goassist3

### Fix Details
- **Issue**: Calendar test failing on weekends (today is Sunday)
- **Root Cause**: MockCalendarService only included Mon-Fri (days 1-5) as working days
- **Solution**: Modified F038 test suite to initialize calendar with all 7 days as working hours
- **Result**: All 860 tests now passing (was 859/860)

## Session 2 - 2025-12-31

### Completed
- Added semi-autonomous mode to CLAUDE.md
- Created AUTONOMOUS-GOVERNANCE.md with full safety protocols
- Added task planning behavior (show plan for new tasks)
- Added "it's up to you" response handling
- Synced toolkit to 10 projects (gpnet3, goassist3, govertical, goconnect, GoAgent, etc.)
- Set up global permissions in ~/.claude.json
- Cleaned up .claude/settings.local.json

### Lines of Code Today
- ~79,000 lines across all projects

### Next Steps
- Test toolkit in a real project (goassist3 avatar work)
- Consider creating lite version with 5 essential commands

### Notes
- Toolkit now operates semi-autonomously by default
- Always shows plan before new tasks
- User can say "it's up to you" and Claude will propose next task

## Session 3 - 2026-01-01

### Completed
- Added Next Actions menu (C/A/H) to /status command output
- Created copy-toolkit.ps1 PowerShell script for syncing toolkit to projects
- Fixed Windows Terminal launcher in Launch-All-Claude.bat
- Demonstrated proper autonomous trigger behavior with model switching
- Committed changes: 2983c71

### Key Improvements
- Toolkit now provides direct navigation options after status check
- Automated toolkit synchronization across multiple projects
- Enhanced Windows Terminal integration for better UX
