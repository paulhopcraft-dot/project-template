# Claude Progress Log

## Session 4 - 2026-01-04

### Completed
- Fixed encoding issues in run-ecosystem-tests.ps1 (Unicode symbols)
- Created run-tests-simple.ps1 (simplified test runner)
- Executed ecosystem tests across all 7 projects
- Generated ECOSYSTEM-TEST-REPORT.md with detailed analysis

### Test Results Summary
- 3 projects PASSED: gpnet3, goconnect, govertical
- 1 project with 1 failing test: GoAgent (calendar.find_free_slots)
- 2 projects with environment issues: gocontrol, gomemory (pytest not in PATH)
- 1 project without tests: goassist3 (no test configuration)

### Key Findings
- GoAgent: 859/860 tests passing (99.9%) - 1 calendar test failing
- Python projects need venv activation in test runner
- Overall ecosystem health is good for Node projects

### Next Steps
- ✅ FIXED: GoAgent calendar test - configured 7-day working hours
- Fix Python test environment (activate venv before pytest)
- Add test configuration to goassist3

### Fix Details
- **Issue**: Calendar test failing on weekends (today is Sunday)
- **Root Cause**: MockCalendarService only included Mon-Fri (days 1-5) as working days
- **Solution**: Modified F038 test suite to initialize calendar with all 7 days as working hours
- **Result**: All 860 tests now passing (was 859/860)

## Session 2 - 2025-12-31

### Completed
- Added semi-autonomous mode to CLAUDE.md
- Created AUTONOMOUS-GOVERNANCE.md with full safety protocols
- Added task planning behavior (show plan for new tasks)
- Added "it's up to you" response handling
- Synced toolkit to 10 projects (gpnet3, goassist3, govertical, goconnect, GoAgent, etc.)
- Set up global permissions in ~/.claude.json
- Cleaned up .claude/settings.local.json

### Lines of Code Today
- ~79,000 lines across all projects

### Next Steps
- Test toolkit in a real project (goassist3 avatar work)
- Consider creating lite version with 5 essential commands

### Notes
- Toolkit now operates semi-autonomously by default
- Always shows plan before new tasks
- User can say "it's up to you" and Claude will propose next task
